<h2>Using Sass</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">All of the Foundation frameworks are written in Sass, which allows us to make the codebase customizable and flexible.</h3>

  <h3>The Settings File</h3>

  <p>All Foundatiion projects include a <em>settings file</em>, named <code>_settings.scss</code>. If you're using the CLI to create a Foundation for Apps project, you can find the settings file under <code>client/assets/scss/</code>. If you're installing the framework standalone using Bower or npm, there's a settings file included in those packages, which you can move into your own Sass files to work with.</p>

  <p>Every component includes a set of variables that modify core structural or visual styles. If there's something you can't customize with a variable, you'll need to write your own CSS to add it.</p>

  <p>To change a default value, find the variable you're looking for, uncomment it by removing the slashes (<code>//</code>) at the start of the line, and change the value. Uncommenting signifies that you want the value to change, and also functions as a handy visual aid to see which defaults you're overriding.</p>

  <p>Here's an example set of settings variables. These change the default styling of buttons:</p>

<hljs language="scss">
$button-padding: 0.85em 1em !default;
$button-margin: 0 $global-padding $global-padding 0 !default;
$button-style: solid !default;
$button-background: $primary-color !default;
$button-color: auto !default;
$button-radius: 0 !default;
$button-sizes: (
  tiny: 0.7,
  small: 0.8,
  medium: 1,
  large: 1.3,
) !default;
$button-font-size: 0.9rem !default;
$button-opacity-disabled: 0.5 !default;
$button-tag-selector: true !default;
</hljs>

  <h3>Component Mixins</h3>

  <p>Every Foundation component is written with multiple Sass mixins. We use these mixins to generate the final CSS output. But you don't need to use our built-in classes! Using the mixins, you can build your own class structure.</p>

  <p>Here's a basic example, using the <code>button()</code> mixin.</p>

<hljs>
// Example mixin for custom button 
.cta-button { 
  @include button(large, $background: pink, $color: white); 
}
</hljs>

  <p>Then you can use your custom button with this HTML:</p>

<hljs>
<a href="#" class="cta-button">Buy Now</a>
</hljs>
